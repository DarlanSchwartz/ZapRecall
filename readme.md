# Zap Recall

- Flashcards are cards that contain a question/statement on the front and an answer on the back. They can be used to train your memory using the Active Recall and Spaced Repetition methodologies. The idea is to read the question or statement and try to remember the answer. When encountering it, depending on the effort required to answer the flashcard or not, you become aware of which contents are fresh in your memory and which are not, so you can practice the ones that aren't frequently.
- When we instantly recall a flashcard, we had a **"Zap!"** âš¡
